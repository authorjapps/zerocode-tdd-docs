Healthy tips do at home
===
-  Exercise Daily.  W.H.O recommends 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a
week.  Online classes, walking, and bodyweight lifts are perfect activities to
take part in while staying quarantined.
- Prioritize fresh products when cooking meals at home.  Prioritize fruits and
vegetables over non-perishables.
- Avoid food waste. Consider freezing leftovers to have as another meal.
- Limit salt intake. Since it is more common now to rely on canned or processed
foods, make sure to watch how much salt is in the foods you are eating.  WHO
recommends consuming less than 5 g of salt per day.
- Clean surfaces and commonly touched surfaces multiple times a day.

Healthy food habits to boost immunity
===
- Citrus fruits.  These fruits help to build your immune system.
- Eating fruits and vegetables with every meal. This part of the food group is
packed with essential vitamins and nutrients.
- Stay hydrated.  Good hydration is very important for optimal health.
- Include leafy greens in your meals.  Arugula, kale, and spinach are perfect
examples to increase disease-fighting cells.
- Eating low-fat yogurt. This is a great mid-day snack that is high in vitamins.

Healthy breathing practices
===
Something as simple as breathing can help both your body and your mind. It can
lower your heart rate, decrease blood pressure, reduce tension and help you feel
less stressed overall. Here is one exercise to try out:
- To begin, sit in a chair in a comfortable position. Place your hands on your
lap, with your back straight and your feet on the floor. You can also lie down
on a couch or bed. Close your eyes if you wish.
- Tune in to how you're feeling. Are you relaxed or stressed? Is your mind calm
or full of racing thoughts? Is your breath slow and full or fast and shallow? Is
your body at ease or are your muscles tense?
- Breathe slowly and deeply through your nose to the count of 1...2...3...4.
- Now breathe out slowly through your mouth to the count of 1...2...3...4.
- Repeat this four times.
- Feel the release in your body and mind as you breathe in, and feel all the
tightness leave as you breathe out. Like an ocean wave, let your breath gently
carry any thoughts or tension away.
- When you're ready, slowly open your eyes and bring your attention back to the
room around you.
