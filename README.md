# Zerocode TDD - Documentation Overview

Zerocode is a powerful, lightweight, and extensible framework that makes it easy to automate API and Kafka data stream regression testing with minimal overhead. It leverages community-driven best practices and supports both JSON and YAML formats for seamless test automation, making it highly adoptable among developers and testers.


## Features

- **Automated Regression Testing**: Perform end-to-end automated regression tests for REST, SOAP, and Kafka microservices via JSON or YAML.
- **API Performance Testing**: Measure and validate API performance and load using simple declarative configurations.
- **Kafka Data Stream Testing**: Test Kafka real-time data streams with automated workflows.
- **Easy Validation**: Effortlessly validate API responses, including headers and body content, using JSON or YAML.
- **CI Integration**: Integrate seamlessly with CI pipelines to automate workflows.

### Example

Here's a sample test for an API endpoint:

#### JSON Example:
```json
{
  "url": "api/v1/customers/123",
  "method": "GET",
  "request": {
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
  },
  "retry": {
    "max": 3,
    "delay": 1000
  },
  "verify": {
    "status": 200,
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": [ "application/json; charset=utf-8" ]
    },
    "body": {
      "id": 123,
      "type": "Premium Visa",
      "addresses": [
        {
          "type": "Billing",
          "line1": "10 Random St"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "verifyMode": "LENIENT"
}
```

#### YAML Example:
```yaml
---
url: api/v1/customers/123
method: GET
request:
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
retry:
  max: 3
  delay: 1000
verify:
  status: 200
  headers:
    Content-Type:
      - application/json; charset=utf-8
  body:
    id: 123
    type: Premium Visa
    addresses:
      - type: Billing
        line1: 10 Random St
verifyMode: LENIENT
```

## IDE Support
Zerocode has excellent support for JetBrains IDEs, making test development and execution seamless.
