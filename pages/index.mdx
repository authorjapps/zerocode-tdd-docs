## What is Zerocode TDD?

Zerocode TDD is a super simple test automation framework suitable for writing fast and repeatable builds with an instantly familiar syntax using JSON or YAML.

It is a community-developed, free, opensource framework built for Microservices APIs, Kafka, Database, Security and Load testing.

Zerocode TDD enables you to create, change, orchestrate and maintain your automated test scenarios declaratively.

It is lightweight and extensible that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
