Only difference here to RAW is the `recordType` value is JSON.

```
"recordType" : "JSON"
```

and we pass the JSON records in the `records` block.

+ See all variation of Produce tests [here](https://github.com/authorjapps/hello-kafka-stream-testing/tree/master/src/test/resources/kafka/produce) including RAW and JSON types.
